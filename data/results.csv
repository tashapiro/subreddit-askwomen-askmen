Me and my wife have been together for some time now and she spent a lot of time on the pill so when we decided to try for a baby we thought it would take some time... It didn't 2nd time trying it and Bam she is pregnant, now a little bit of backstory.

Childhood wasn't the best and I always told myself that if I was going to be a dad I would try to be the best that I could but even thought I thought this, I never fully managed to imagine myself becoming a dad. Maybe I still haven't fully taken in the fact , maybe it still hasn't really hit me... Im a bit afraid of how emotionless Im feeling... 

I always wanted to try and have my life straightned out to provide a good childhood for a kid, ( having a bit of side money, beeing in the process of buying a house... those things) but I feel im still on my way to doing so and that that can come in the way of properly raising a child.

104,10525,"Why is Thermal Male Contraception not studied more as a viable option?  

After multiple problems with different forms of contraception, my girlfriend and I came across a rarely spoken about option, where as men we can take control of the responsibility.

The idea of the contraceptive method is to maintain the testicles closer to the body to increase their local temperature, significantly reducing spermiogenesis over longer periods of time, as above 37°C spermiogenesis is limited, by using one form or another of a physical barrier between the testicles and their access to the scrotum.

In my case, this is a video demonstration of the solution I wanted to use. **NSFW WARNING: depiction of male genitalia**

[-switch-en-video/](-switch-en-video/)

After speaking about the option with 2 different doctors, one a general clinician, one an andrologist, both men categorically refused to maintain follow ups on the matter on the basis that, scientifically speaking, there is not enough data to recommend the method.

My question is simple: why?

From the studies that have taken place, the method shows safety, effectiveness, reversibility and few side affects for the most part; as potential counter argument, what I see in the below study is 'degeneration of seminiferous tubules' and 'significant decrease of serum testosterone with increase of prolactin' but that these effects were reversed within 6 months of stopping the method.  
Study in question:

[]()

Surely something this promising would have been studied further? It seems insane to me.

Here are some of the studies in question I have come across, maybe someone can explain to me why these studies might be no good and it's a bad idea to use TMC methods. Most of these studies are referenced between themselves

It is simply depressing the amount of Karens and Kevins there are, people not mature enough to accept that not everybody agrees with you, that you didn't get a job because well, you weren't good enough, that you got fired because you were a drug addict, that you didn't get a house for the price you wanted because somebody else was paying more, the amount of people that hold grudges for decades to come...

Yet in this day and age, everyone can claim you are a pedophile, a rapist, a drug addict or a dealer, that you cheated or that you abuse you parents.

And they get away with it. Companies only care about clickbait and hide behind freedom of speech or not wanting to censor every post each user posts.

It wouldn't be such a big issue if it hadn't consequences in real life, but nowadays so many employers do a quick internet search before hiring anybody, and if they see any red flag like rapist, drugs, pedophile, they don't inquire more, they simply move on.

Let’s say a girl commonly (not always) posts photos where she’s wearing things like crop tops, bralettes, short shorts, lingerie costumes for Halloween vs a girl, who can dress sexy, but doesn’t show as much skin on her social media and chooses a costume that covers more. 

With that example in mind: Would you think the one who posts in a borderline lingerie costume is more attractive in the sense that you’d actually take them seriously (not just in a sexual context) like “Wow she’s gorgeous I want to date her” over someone who dressed in something sexy but is usually more covered with their outfits? If you find them both attractive- is there a difference in the type of attraction you feel/do you take the ones who choose to dress-in-less more or less seriously and would pursue them in a genuine way or is the one who dresses modestly, but is still sexy, the one you’d prefer to pursue? Ie: at the end of the day who would you be more attracted to physically and seriously?

Once a year I drive 12 hrs to see him and his family and spend a weekend and it's like we saw each other yesterday. I am blessed to have this relationship. I'm the crude, whiskey drinking foul mouthed friend your wife hates but understands you need. And I love the fact she understands this. I'm 40, no kids, motorcycle riding veteran ... and I'm treated like a brother from his well off family. He's a devout catholic with 5 kids... but I'll be Goddard if they dont find a sitter for the weekend and fucking party everytime. I love this dude more than my own brother.

I've always treated women in my life with respect despite some minor fuck ups. But throughout my life, the men I've known and the things they're into and how they talk about women when they're not around, how deceptive they can be etc, really just has me completely clueless about how you could explain to a woman how men really tend to be and how to pick out a good guy when you see one. I have no idea.

I don't want the answer ""let her make mistakes and learn"" bc ofc she's going to do that anyways.

He was finally comfortable enough seeing me there to give me a glare and the “what’s up” head nod. I gestured back but quickly avoided eye contact and bolted the other way. Now if I show up he’s out the door in 2 minutes. That’s how he would act at first. I’d be at the gym and he’d leave within 10 minutes even if he JUST showed up. Eventually he got over the fact that we would run into each other there but since I avoided his gesture recently, he started leaving again when I would show up. 

To give more context, our relationship was 5 months on and off. He ended it multiple times because 1.) I don’t smoke weed and 2.) I believe in God. He equated it to believing in Santa Claus and was convinced I was delusional. As for the weed thing, he wanted a girl that would smoke with him and it just wasn’t my thing anymore.

696,13676,"MOD POST: REPORTS AND YOU Whaddup nerds

I'm here to remind you that if you like this subreddit the way it is and want it to stay this way, **you too can help!**

As you all know the mods *dO iT fOr FrEe* and God knows I can't be fucked to read the posts on this place more than absolutely necessary.

Here's where you come in: if you report a comment or post, it conveniently comes up in our modqueue so we can ~~take appropriate action~~ yeet that shit.

Here's a quick guide: 

What **not** to report:

* Disagreement. If a comment is well worded, decently polite and not a direct attack, I don't care that it hurts your fee-fees or goes against your agenda. We're not the thought police. 

* Women commenting in the subreddit. Holy fuck, I dont know why this is still a thing but again, *women are allowed and encouraged to comment and post here*. It's a breath of fresh new perspective for all you virgins on here. So stop whining that there are girls in your sandbox, cooties aren't real.

What **to report**:

* Actual harassment. If people are being assholes for no reason, do let us know so we can ban that shit. If people follow your comments or harass you via PM **definitely report to the admins**. 

* Incel/MGTOW/FDS garbage. This may go against my first point about disagreement a bit but not like these people can ever be nice. You'll know em when you see em.

* Whining about other subreddits. This is vital in battling brigading and other forms of harassment that don't fucking fly here. Kinda ties in with the previous point.

* Blatant sexism/racism. This kinda goes without thinking. 

* Foreveralone self-pity comments and posts. ""I wish i had a girlfriend"", ""my hand lol"" etc, these guys cop a 2 day ban so they're reminded that wallowing in self pity won't get them a fucking girlfriend and they should go the fuck outside.

* Anything else that breaks rule 1: ""don't be an asshole"". Pointless slapfights, insluts, etc. 

* Frequently Asked posts. Regular users on the sub know best what kind of question pops up all the fucking time. So report it as FAQ, helps us in the future. Automoderator is pretty aggressively set up but things still get through so we appreciate any help with this we can get.

* Posts/comments that break any of the other rules. I don't have time to go through them all, but they're available in the sidebar or wherever the fuck all these mobile apps put that shit.

* Spam/advertising. There's been a trend of a person making a ""what app do you use?"" Thread and a second account posting their app. That's an example, most other ads are way more blatant than this. As well as any kind of serial (shit)posters.

Warning: sexual topic will be mentioned.

Hello,

I just wanted to express some thoughts and a tough situation I'm going through...

This is about a relationship and about managing feelings of guilt and regret. So without furder ado let me set the topic. First off, I'm a male (27) that has had a long past of dating a bunch of girls with a lot of fear of commitment fueled by feeling no one was that ''perfect'' person for me, that had all the qualities I ''needed'' and ''wanted'', leading to breaking many hearts in an unintentional way, but I was seen as cold or unattainable... I've always been a very anxious person that always overthinks EVERYTHING making me insecure. I don't really let people see it as people label me as a confident guy.

Out of all my experience of love and dating, I met this girl (21) that changed my whole perspective of love, she was all that I wanted, we had the best chemistry I've ever had in my 27 years of age and I felt she was truly the one. The point is I don't know if I dragged issues from my past as an inmature selfish man but I hurt this girl greatly, in ways that till this day haunt me and I haven't been able to function properly.

She's been a girl with a difficult childhood, with her dad leaving her and she had always been insecure with herself and how she looks. We started dating and she set boundaries that I tried to respect. One of those boundaries was having protected sex at all times. One day we were having a good time in what seemed a normal date, drank a lot of wine and got very drunk... We had sex in the car and I got carried away and took off my condom so I could feel for the first time the experience with her without feeling I couldn't enjoy it. This was my worst mistake. This stupid decision brought a lot of pain to her, and felt I disrespected her desire and body which I agree fully... She even began self harming herself because she felt I broke her, this aggravated my mental health because I don't ever want to be the cause of such a horrible thing. I can't even begin to describe how much remorse and regret and guilt and despair my selfish choice is causing over me since I truly love this girl. We tried to brush it off and continue our relationship but about a month later she broke up with me because she thinks we should heal and grow apart... She felt that being with me after what I did was disrespecting herself. I agreed because I wanted to respect her wishes and not be selfish again even though I still feel we could've grown and overcome it together.

The first weeks were surreal so I wasn't suffering that much, but then reality kicked in and I started to realize that it wasn't a break but more a permanent decision of leaving me... It's not being long since her decision, 3 months, but know I just feel so guilty that I did that to her and that I lost my only true love for being selfish. We agreed to blocking each other to reduce the desire to contact ourselves but I have this intermittent urges of knowing how she is doing, how she feels and saying how sorry and bad I feel... I can't even work, can't sleep well, having had an appetite in weeks and I just feel I'm self-flagellating and hurting myself mentally as punishment.

Please let know your input in this situation and I accept all kind of criticism because I know what I did was horrible...

Thank you so much for reading.",AskWomen,AskMen,False
728,18925,"Why aren't men into me? Hey guys, 26F, its been a couple of months since my relationship ended and Ive been trying to date men. Im not having great success and I know it has to be me but I can't pin point the problem.

So to get this out of the way, please please don't think im narcissistic, I hate talking about myself and these are all my good qualities ...

Ive been told my whole life I am a very beautiful girl. And there are days I would agree, other days not so much. But I don't wear much make up, I don't wear/care about expensive clothes and jewelry (I rather spend money at REI), I have a very athletic build (5'2, 115). I am a passionate medical student and I love what I do and what Im learning. I eat very healthy, exercise daily, Im outdoorsy, an advanced hiker, beginner mountaineer. Im an independent traveler (except my husky shepherd joins me) that has seen many places in the world, and a paraglider. I love humans so much, I love listening to people and hearing their stories. I love making human connections and feeling peoples energy. I love off roading and listening to TOOL and SOAD. I am a happy and nice human.

I start talking to men (mainly through dating apps), and I can tell they're immediately turned on because im pretty and ""look sweet"". But the more I talk with them, less likely are they to want to meet in person or even continue talking to me. I don't get it? I make sure to talk about them and their lives. If they take hours/days to answer I don't get mad because I know they're probably busy, I don't annoy or hit the up, but I am also down to grab a coffee or go for a hike. How do I get men to be more attracted to me? Should I stop talking about off roading, TOOL/Metallica, medicine, my travel adventures?

876,10417,"How do I stand up for myself and put in boundaries without seeming overly sensitive or highly strung? maybe it’s just little things like dumb insults (ribbing, I give as good as I receive) or major things like I don’t know, your friends not inviting you to a party on your birthday, but I often have trouble standing up for my self in the moment because I usually don’t like to seem like the aggressor or make a scene about stuff, it’s just not me. 

My parents keep saying that I need to lay down boundaries with people and not be a walking  doormat for people.  They say that my mentality is similar to Victims of domestic abuse, thinking that they’re going to change or get better. Hey 

For example: I have an older friend whom my parents are paying to work out with me, but he’s also a friend.  Recently the sessions have been inconsistent. We usually work out 3x a week but haven’t had a session in  about 2 weeks. He’s been having phone problems recently.

I tried to arrange a session on Friday for Saturday, the day of the session I called him and texted, he didn’t reply for  2 days so it didn’t happen. 

my parents are saying that I need to lay down a boundary that if he does this again, especially since we are-paying him, we end the sessions. I’m uncomfortable talking to him about it cause I don’t want it to be awkward and to ruin our sessions. 
 
A bit long winded, but the basic point is that I struggle to lay boundaries and stand up for myself. I usually don’t want to attract a scene or overreact to in some cases, childish ribbing, in other cases, more serious stuff. 

I fear that this is making other people that I wanna be friends with also view me in a negative way.

How do I tell my wife I want to leave my job and pursue a more fulfilling (but much lower payingNd less secure) career? Last year I moved my family over 1000 miles across the country for my job.  It seemed like a great opportunity to explore a new part of the country, as well as advance my career.  The caveat was, due to licensing &amp; compliance issues, my wife would have to quit her job and become a full time stay-at-home Mom.  We have two young girls, who aren’t school age yet.  The lovely women she is, didn’t even blink an eye, and told me she’d do it for me &amp; our family because at the time I really wanted to take the opportunity.

I work for a Fortune 50 Aerospace &amp; Defense company, designing processes for overhauling &amp; repairing jet engine parts.  Even is this economy it’s a rather secure job, with good benefits, and above average pay.  However, after a year of doing it, I’m regretting uplifting my family from their home, taking them away from what was a great school system, and mostly taking my wife away from a career she worked so hard to break through in.  She’s always been one to “play it safe” through out her life, so making this move was out of character for her.

A few months ago, after she told me I was “grumpy” one morning, she told me to “go make something, you’re always happy when you’re making thing”.  So I did as she asked, I went out to my wood shop, (which is 75% smaller after the move) and built a reading-nook for my daughter.  Turns out, she was right, by the time the afternoon rolled around I was in a much better mood.

This got me thinking, why am I going to a job everyday that I don’t like, when I build furniture, do home renovations, etc, that makes me much more happy...I have absolutely no idea?!?  What I really want to do is quit this job, and start a home renovation/construction business.  Making things, makes me happy.  I don’t know how to break this to my wife, she gave up so much for me and I don’t know how to again take away her &amp; my children’s security for another and very different career pursuit.

TL;DR: I moved my family over 1000 miles for a new job.  My wife had to put her career on hold, and become a stay at home Mom in order to make it happen.  Now, I want to quit my new job and pursue a more fulfilling career, but don’t know how to tell m my wife.",AskMen,AskMen,True

I’d borrowed it over the weekend when it made sense for me to head over there while he was out for an hour or so, but I made sure I left it on the side after that and didn’t keep it. 

This morning when we were leaving for work, I almost forgot my charger and had to run back in for it, to which he said “wouldn’t have been a big deal, you’ve got your key haven’t you?”. I told him I’d not kept it and he then took my car keys and put the spare key to his house on the keychain. “Keep it” he said.

I’m so psyched about this - I’m completely in love with him and very happy, but wondering if I’m reading too much into it? We’ve been together about 4/5 months and I spend 5/6 nights a week at his place.. currently helping him renovate his whole house from top to bottom (which most of the decisions re interior decor have been down to me).

To clarify, this ex and I did not break up on good terms and I’ve asked him on multiple occasions to leave me alone. Whenever he messages me, I used to ignore them and block him. 

But things have changed now. He keeps on creating new numbers and new facebook accounts to contact me. I’m at my wits end and finally messaged him back saying, “I’ve asked you on multiple occasions to leave me alone and to never contact me again. I have screenshot our conversations and if I hear from you again, I will notify the police for harassment and stalking.”

He replied, “Lol, go ahead and try it. I’m going to do what I want.”

I know they get to pick who they want. But I guess that's the point. Women keep gazing, smiling, holding long eye contact. I know the difference between a flirty smile and a polite smile. I know girls who hate me who never give me flirty smiles and I know girls I know of less who do it continuously. I feel like it's because they know they can use me for attention and then just drop me/flirting whenever they get with who they want. I like girls who are honest and communicate their disinterest through body language way more and appreciate them more than girls who don't.

1435,14061,"Men (and people with penises), if every birth control option that is available to women was also available to you, which one would you use and why ? &amp;#x200B;

So, if every birth control method that was available for women was also available for men (with the same potential side effects) would you take it and, if so, which one would you choose ? For the sake of this hypothetical scenario,for people who don’t have a vagina/uterus, let’s pretend things that would go in a vagina go in another cavity in your body and also you bleed every month, otherwise you won’t have the pleasure to experience all the potential side effects.

&amp;#x200B;

*Here is a list of your options  :*

**Pills** : most common, you have to take them everyday, if used correctly, very efficient (like 99,5%) but can be affected by other medication or even regurgitated and therefore become ineffective. Since it’s hormonal, the side effects can include mood swings, loss of sex drive,etc. Oh and rarely but still, blood clots as well and other things probably but I’m not a doctor.

**IUD** : has to be placed somewhere in your body (insertion can be painful), once it’s in though, you can almost not feel it and you don’t have to really worry about it for several years. Some work with hormones and have the same side-effects as the pill, but you can also get a copper IUD which doesn’t contain any hormones but can make your periods (yes let’s pretend you bleed every month as well) quite painful/long

**Implant** (Nexplanon i think?) : it’s the size of a match and it is inserted via syringe under your skin in your upper arm. It works with hormones as well, you can feel it under your skin but they are known to have many side effects for a lot of people. Can either completely stop your periods or make them much worse or just give you random blood spots once every few months. It’s 99,5 % effective and lasts 3 years but after that you have to have it removed and replaced (it can be a little painful)

**Patch** : literally a patch you put on your skin, same as if you were trying to quit smoking. Hormonal as well, you must be careful to change it on time, can cause the same side effects as other hormonal methods. (also just like the pill, in theory 99,5 % effective, in practice it’s more like 91 % because people forget to change it, or don’t put it the right way etc.)

**Shots** every few months :  same as other hormonal birth control for side effects, you also have to go to the doctor every few month to get them  

**Vaginal rings** : you have to put it inside your body and change it once every month, they are hormonal as well so all of the other side effects apply (91 % effective)

**Condoms** : well i don’t have to explain that one too much, very useful both for birth control but also preventing STDs, they come in a variety of shapes and sizes and are not hormonal so no side effects for you BUT sex is less intimate and possible a bit more technical (you have to be careful with it so it’s used properly etc.)

**Sterilization** : most effective I imagine but you can never have biological children (all the childfree people reading this, thinking « Well duh, even better »)

**Something else ?** I know I haven’t included every single method because those are just the ones I am aware of, so i’ll link the planned parenthood website if you want a complete overview of your options. I didn’t include withdrawal because I know for a fact that it is not effective (thanks mom and dad for being stupid).

1437,15299,"What are some real life superpowers you have observed? Just because we cant fly or throw cars doesnt mean that certain abilities that put people above others isnt real. 

1. Beauty is a super power. Im not talking about just being atrractive. People who are truly beautiful can access lifestyles and opputunities FAR eaiser than the average person. Especially gorgeous woman. As long as you keep your reputation in order, a woman who is a true 10 has the oppurtunity to never have to work her entire life. In the lap of luxuary. Where as with gorgeous men they automaticly command respect, especially if they are athletic. This ability to control people is something even if superstregh was real couldnt be contained. 

2. The ability to sing is a super power. You always have the ability to make money.  Just like with beauty im not talking about the average singer. Im talking about people like Areatha franklin who have an inate powerful ability to sing. You can literally make a career doing small gigs and never having to punch a clock. For example my piano teacher was an opera singer in college. This man has never had a real job since highschool and just does small and midlevel gigs around the south. And he is loaded. Drives a damn range rover. Also how many stories have we seen of a homeless person who life was changed just because it was discovered they can sing. 

3. Being well endowed as a man is a super power. I know this sounds silly but it is. Penis size is something many many men are insecure about. And factually knowing that you are secure in that area is a boost to self esteem. And it keeps woman enticed, especially if you are good at sex. 

4. Charisma is a real superpower as well. There are numerous people who can motive and command people just because. They have something that makes people like them. No matter what. I always like to compare the Rock and John cena. Despite john cena literally looking like the embodyment of america, the rock career is still above his. Because the rock has a level of charisma that is inate. And he was just as charasmatic before he got massive, back in the early 2000s when he was skinny rock. This has allowed the rock to become one of the highest grossing entertainers ever, despite coming from humble beginings. He single handedly revived the fast franchise.

Everyone just accepts that and it isn't sitting right with me. I cannot tell you how many times I've had to assure people (especially other women) that men are capable of doing simple tasks and of critical thinking skills outside of the workplace. I also feel like a lot of men take advantage of this fact to just not have to expel effort in their personal lives, which in of itself is troubling. So does this make you angry?

Sooooo,

Fuck me... I just found out two days ago my girlfriend is pregnant. We have been together two years and she is absolutely the person I love most in this world. 

I’m only 22 and she’s only 20. I’m scared, I’m nervous, I’m stressed, and I’m excited. I’ve always wanted kids but I really was not ready to have one yet. 

What the fuck do I do now? I have a decent job that pays the bills for us, but I doubt it could cover having a kid. I have no idea how to raise a kid. 

My parents got pregnant at 19 and they did amazing raising us, I just have no idea how they got over the fear of the whole process. They also got divorced and were very unhappy together for a long time. I really don’t want to lose her. She is my world and I don’t want to have her feel like she is stuck because we are having a kid together. But how the fuck do I tell her that?

I’ve always heard being a parent is the hardest but most rewarding thing that can come to you in life. Right now it’s just scary. I work 60 hour weeks to pay the bills and leave us enough to live comfortably. 

I think my first step is a plan to change careers where I can cut hours down to a normal work week and still make a little more than enough to support all three of us.

1828,17574,"Why have I never had any guy friends? So I’m 18 and I’ve literally never had any guy friends. I’ve probably had 2 in my life, that I was genuinely close to. The first one, ended up having a crush on me ( we dated but that’s a long story ). And the second one now, just told me he has a crush on me and asked to be my girlfriend. I have trouble making guy friends but the 2 I actually do, both ended up liking me? Is it something I did? Maybe I’m not used to it so I latch on to them but no idea. ( I didn’t like them back ) . I think I’m just being nice, not flirty or anything.

And in school, guys just never talked to me. And I know I’m alright looking. I took pride in my appearance, I did my hair etc. I know I looked “pretty”. I am very shy, I don’t like going up to people first. I do have a resting hitch face. I probably crossed my arms so that makes me look uninviting. I feel like my quietness and shyness is taken as me being “oh she thinks she’s better than us” or very standoffish. :( 
I didn’t have many friends in school either ( had some really good ones, but besides them I literally wasn’t properly friends with anyone ).
* it is a new country, I don’t speak the language well / people love to laugh at how bad I speak it which is annoying. But maybe that plays a part? Idk *

Anyways, at school I’ll literally be with a group of boys and they just won’t even TRY to talk to me. The guys in my class just won’t talk to me, ever. One guy made a big deal about having to sit with me when the teacher made him move. ( which makes me think there’s something WRONG with me. Maybe IM doing something that’s pushing everyone away but I just don’t know ). But I suppose he was just acting pissed to be funny

Was too drunk to get it up the first time, and after our first date, had the same issue. She was understanding and I was finally able to get it up.

So we dated for a few months (my first real relationship) and it ended about a month ago. 2 weeks ago, I hooked up with a girl I had just met after a party. I was struggling to keep it up bc I was drunk, but we finally had sex. Next morning I was rock hard but was nervous about losing it, and kind of rushing myself to do it, and couldn’t get to it.

2006,13629,"How to get rid of feeling like shit every day? (its gonna be a really long post so get ready)
It's been too long. Tbh, I don't really know how exactly I feel, its like it is a mix of feeling regret for my cringy past (its' influence in my daily life was drastically decreased, but I stil get that nasty feeling for being such an idiot in the past), hesitation for whether my struggle to become a better version will be in vain or not and most of all feeling of idleness. I tried everything that came across my mind: from working out and working on my discipline to just letting myself go as I please. Every single day begins with the thought: why the hell do I need to get up, what for? Even though I still get up, the feeling of idleness doesn't get away and instead haunts me throughout the whole day. Whatever I do - its still there, for example I need to do dumbbells: I approach them, grab them and when I'm about to lift them I instantly get a debuff in motivation because I know how much I have to work to get the type of body I want and that there's no guarantees that I will succeed in the end. Thanks to my stubbornity I do it anyway, but it it is given to me with great difficulty than it should be. Another example goes from my relationship experience: lets say once upon a time I met someone that seemed like potential new friend at first, we speak with pleasure with each other and everything goes the way I wanted for a long time. But then some prick who knew the worse version of me (from my cringy past that is) tells the worst things and even sometimes exaggerate something or doesn't tell the whole story. Then a human I was in good relationship with for a solid period of time just lets that disgusting abomination turn his opinion about me 180 degrees. After that he tells that he no longer wants to be friends with me. Things like that destroy the confidence and assurance in building good relationship with anyone. Things are much better now, ofcourse. But sediment still remains (for all curious people who wonder what kind of past I have: lets just say that back then I was too emotionally excited about everything when I finally went to school for my first time, I was too pushy when it came to relationships, etc.).
These three sabotage my life every day. It wouldn't be such a problem if there was one problem that bothers me at a time, but its never like it these days.

So today I have not one problem, but many at one time. And my question is simple: how does one get over things like that?

I see people my age (I’m 22) having nights out with friends, be it a party, concert, bar or even just driving around. I can’t help but feel an unreasonable amount of jealousy. I don’t ever really have nights out, not even Friday or Saturday nights. Every week that goes by that I don’t, I feel more like a loser and I’m missing out. I don’t have a solid core group of friends, just a few here and there, but none are ever down to do wild fun things or are just always busy. 

I’ve got lots to be thankful for. I have a cool job, a peaceful family that I spend time with, those few friends I mentioned, and hobbies and big goals. But when night hits and everyone’s out enjoying life, I’m always stuck at home and it bothers the hell out of me. Lately I’ve been trying to fill my off days with more outdoor adventures. But it’s gotten to a point where I can’t even enjoy those cause I either have no one to accompany me, which sucks, or, my brain reminds me that I don’t have that core group of friends and that I never go out. 

I sort of regret not going to college. That’s where I see the vast majority of people found their groups. My dream job just never required it. But damn does it look fun but I know it’s not a good idea to go just for the fun times. So I’ll carry that burden that I missed out on it. 

I just want my Friday and Saturday nights to be spent with people who want to let loose. Even just Friday nights. But I am so lost on how to make genuine friendships anymore and it seems like everyone has their established groups already. I also wish I had more adventurous friends or people that want to accompany me in my hobbies.

2180,5051,"What Makes You A Woman? [20F] Hi friends,

Before I begin I just want to give thanks for being here. I love this subreddit, it has provided guidance I needed (and didn't know I needed); I am grateful for all of you that participate in making us feel held &amp; seen. 

I am a 20 year old young woman who finds myself consistently treating myself like an insecure teenage girl rather than a powerful, actualized, confident woman who knows her worth. It shows up in financial instability and insecurity; the way I feel and talk to myself; settling for mediocrity that I'm discontented with—and staying there; general disappointment with the world around me and how I interact with it; I struggle maintaining joy, laughter, and beauty throughout the day because inevitably I'm drawn to sources of stress, etc. 

My ideal self looks like this:
I'm financially smart and independent, I'm witty and sassy and tough when I need to be. I am able to get myself organized and structured (and feel fulfilled and purposeful when I do) but I am not so rigid that I cannot be spontaneous and fun, fluid, playful and joyous. Like I want to be that badass, confident solo woman who commands the room, *and* young at heart, big smile and laughter who can be carefree, enjoying every moment of life no matter what circumstance, making lemons into lemonade. 

TL;DR/My questions to you are these: 
How do I create that version of myself, where I can move fluidly between both sides, whilst feeling that's authentically me, not just a facade?
What makes *you* a woman? 
Are the expectations I have of womanhood realistic and maintainable, or just Hollywood fantasies?
How did you metamorphisize out of girlhood into womanhood?
What does self-love look &amp; feel like internally (not just as a theory?)

There's a FWB I have who wants to date but is very disrespectful. I don't take him serious because he's so mean and rude to me...its so embarrassing to even bring up.

Last month we got into an argument because he wanted me to stop dating other men.. I told him I was dating others and had been clear about that since day 1 (a year ago). Anyway he kicked me out his house etc etc and blocked me.

He didn't talk to me for two weeks and then unblocked me trying to act as if nothing happened. I didn't fall for it. Instead we had small talk and when there was no apology, i decided not to answer his texts. As time went on, I started to feel like it was for the best...he's done some really messed up things like called me a GD when I told him I wanted a cab home or one time he told me i was replaceable as a lightbulb (but keeps coming back).

So a month goes back and i finally reply because Id rather just end it. He had blocked me again and a day later, unblocked me then turned on his read receipts. His birthday was the next day, I said happy birthday and realized that he blocked me AGAIN after unblocking me to see I read it.

We used to live in the same apartment complex in college—he was my next door neighbor. We’re from the same hometown, and our college town is only about 30 minutes from our houses. He went to a different high school, so we never crossed paths until college.

When we first came to know each other, we randomly hooked up one day around 5:00 in the morning. It lasted about ten minutes; we were both exhausted at the time—we just laugh about it now. I also drunkenly threw up in his bed one night…we laugh about that one too. 

We both find each other extremely attractive, and we’ve made that known to each other; I’m his type, and he’s my type. We’re always telling each other of our accomplishments and daily endeavors. We watch the same shows and movies and always discuss them. We play video games together, and I always support him and his friends when they stream. I also constantly support and promote his business—without him asking me to do so. We’ve gotten to the point where we randomly facetime each other, just to talk about some small matter, and those calls always turn out to be hours long. I always tell him how much I value and respect him, and he always tells me how much he values and cherishes me. We have even shared fleeting moments where we joke about getting married…*or are we joking? I don’t even know.*

But, here’s the catch…we have this unspoken little competition going on. He tells me about girls he pulls and then later rejects, and I tell him about guys I pull and also end up rejecting. We’re constantly complaining/joking to each other about how we wish we could just create “the perfect partner.” Sometimes I just want to scream at him, “SHE’S STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU DUMBASS!” My girlfriends, and even guy friends, tell me that he’s “probably too scared to make the first move.” I don’t think so. I know he enjoys the fact that I’m always a little out-of-reach, as I enjoy that about him. 

But…I’ve come to the realization that I am truly, completely, most definitely…madly in love with this outstanding man. I just haven’t a single clue what to do about it.",AskMen,AskMen,True

Recently started working at a new job and from the first day I started working there, the girls at the job one in particular I’ll call her Anna was very interested in me, I played it cool was fairly non chap at to them even though I tend to flirt with (open doors for, talk to etc) most women that come thru the store.

I eventually asked Anna for her number but she told me to wait tell she got off (later on I found out she actually came back and waited for close to 2 hours for me to come talk to her but I didn’t) because I didn’t want to come off needy so I pretty much didn’t really talk to her to much after that outside of random small talk.

Once I decided not to make another move she would literally flirt with dudes right in front of me then glance at me to see if I was paying attention typically I’ll just ignore her sometimes even smile, even talked to a dude she was flirting with right after her and we actually had a pretty cool conversation.

Now there’s this dude that usually comes in and flirts with all the girls in the store has given them rides on occasion and I wouldn’t be surprised if he smashed before i started working there, well he comes in last night and I figured something was up because Anna in particular literally constantly walked u to talk to me every 20 min and we actually talked more last night then we did the entire time I was working there, (I even brought up hanging out and she was for it) my cars in the shop so it’s not like I could’ve gave her a ride.

Once I understand what likely going on (she literally wore legging showing off her ass for the first time since I worked there and ofc this is when she decided to be extra friendly)

I’m not going to lie I ended up pressing the dude and asked to speak to him outside (they told me he carries a gun but I didn’t give a fuck) which he was afraid the girls ended up the diffusing the situation, we both left though he probably did come back and one of the girls had a huge smirk on her face.

I’m going to be out of town for the next 3 days and don’t know what to do I’m also certain he messes with the manager as well, I typically am a firm believer in not shitting where you eat but I felt like I had no choice if i didn’t talk to them they’d be visibly pissed and would make the work environment awkward.

All of my friends and family around me are always telling me they either love their job or what their job has allowed them to do outside of it. I have just come to the realization that I will never strictly enjoy work, it's just a job, a means to an end. Unless I'm missing something

So the next logical step is to have things outside of a job that are enjoyable or fulfilling, but I don't have any of those either. I have tried numerous things; instruments, physical activities, creative outlets. I try and give these things an honest effort before I drop them because I'm not enjoying them, and have realized that I can't really derive joy from anything anymore. It feels as though there isn't enough time in a day to constantly be throwing things at a wall until something sticks. At this point I'm just kind of existing with no real ambition, purpose, or end goal, and want to know if anyone else has felt the same way or has some way out of this?

I always thought it was the women who generally wouldn't date a shorter guy and that's fine we all have preferences. However I was talking to one of my best friends this evening and he just said he couldn't date a woman taller than he. I was kind of blown away. He said it would make him feel weird and insecure.

Currently i've\[M/25\] been thinking a lot on how i interact with others or how i present myself to new people. But lately i've been super conscious on how i'm with around them in terms of like a friendship or when it comes on dating someone. I'm more of a serious person, a bit more reserved due to past experiences and insecurities and with therapy i'm trying to get better with time and deal with that stuff.

But often times i feel that i need to be more funny, charismatic, etc. and those are things for example that i see on my friends, and i watch them get along a bit better with other people or socialize better.

And that leaves me with that feeling that i need to be more on that, funny and charismatic, more interesting person or have something to say everytime i talk to others or when it comes to dating because i feel that's what they look for, for a men with those characteristics. And really it overwhelms me a lot and sometimes i feel i'm just forcing all that or i think that without that i don't have anything to offer to them.

I would like to hear from others, probably with more experience that i'm if there's anything that i should take in consideration or how i can work on that and don't care to much on that?

2959,19721,"How do you deal with wet dreams? Hi fellow men. I (21M) really hate wet dreams. I try to avoid porn/fapping most of the time as I find it distracts me from work/relationships. However, after 5–7 days of abstinence I will always have a wet dream at some point. I‘ve found that having a regular sleep schedule and waking up early seem to help, as wet dreams usually happen in the morning, so reducing the % of time spent in bed each morning works. However, sometimes I work late and just want a sleep-in, which is when I’m hit with the gross effects of wet dreams, both physical and mental.

I have some older friends who say they basically fap for the main reason of avoiding wet dreams. I know most people my age probably jerk off on the daily, so they don’t have to deal with wet dreams much. I’m also not sexually active, while some people I know obviously use sex as an alternative to wanking.

He said ""it was before your glow up"" and he also said the only way he would tag me is if I archive those old posts and just keep the new one of myself. I knew exactly why he was saying this because I knew his friends would try and follow me and then see my old posts, in which he would probably get ""embarrassed"" because I looked different. After I told him that was really shallow he kept telling me it was a joke and that he was sorry. This really hurt me because he also has posts of himself that aren't the most appealing, but it's not like I would ever say anything to him about it.

My (25F) and my partner (26M) were having a debate on whether or not men prefer women to wear a bra.

I work at a store that sells bras, lingerie &amp; undies (etc)
It is part of my job to ensure women are wearing the correct bra and the amount of hassle we go through to find the right one.. I am a qualified Bra Fitter.

I was having a discussion at work with a lady and she had asked “why do we have to wear these things?” And I replied with “men”. 

I had told this to my partner and he said “that’s no true, most men would prefer for a woman to wear no bra, we hate them”. 

We then got into a debate about it and he said to me “if you made men vote on this, the majority would choose ‘no bra’” 

Which then leads me to this post xD To determine the higher vote.

So when I was obese, I was attracted towards thin/petite women( those with small boobs) only. I never found women with big boobs and cute butts( like Eva Green) attractive at all. Like I couldn't even fap to their pictures lmao.

He was finally comfortable enough seeing me there to give me a glare and the “what’s up” head nod. I gestured back but quickly avoided eye contact and bolted the other way. Now if I show up he’s out the door in 2 minutes. That’s how he would act at first. I’d be at the gym and he’d leave within 10 minutes even if he JUST showed up. Eventually he got over the fact that we would run into each other there but since I avoided his gesture recently, he started leaving again when I would show up. 

To give more context, our relationship was 5 months on and off. He ended it multiple times because 1.) I don’t smoke weed and 2.) I believe in God. He equated it to believing in Santa Claus and was convinced I was delusional. As for the weed thing, he wanted a girl that would smoke with him and it just wasn’t my thing anymore.

We had met a few times briefly before we started talking, and my friend let me know that she was into me. I was super excited because she is super cute and I was definitely interested in her. I thought our first date went pretty well. We went out for dinner and had some good conversations. The date ended with us making out in the back of my car for about an hour. We didn’t have sex but it did get pretty heated. She made the move to start making out so I figured she was definitely interested in me. Over the next few days after the date she became more distant over Snapchat. We were snapping for a little over a week before our first date and she was always quick to respond and never left me on open. I asked her out for a second date and she said she was busy but that she might be around next weekend. After that she stopped snapping me completely. The weekend came around and she still didn’t reach out to me. I didn’t contact her at all as to not come off as clingy. It bothered me for a few days but I figured she just wasn’t interested anymore so I moved on. About a week after that though I get a snap from her. It was just a selfie so I assumed it could just be for a streak, but why wait so long especially since we had a streak before which she broke. We snapped multiple times a day for the next few days before I became tired of it and just asked her if she wanted to go out again this coming weekend. She said that she may be working but is not sure yet so she will let me know. Alright cool. We continued snapping Even into the weekend yet she never reached out saying whether she was busy or not. After the weekend she stopped snapping me again out of nowhere. That was 3 weeks ago. I did not reach out once in those 3 weeks. In my mind it was over and I was fine with that. But this week she snaps me again. Except this time it is much more frequent, very similar to before we went on the first date, like 20-30 snaps per day, and she is starting conversations. Do you think she is still interested, or wants me to ask her out again? I am getting tired of asking her out and getting told she is busy. I’ve told myself that if she actually cares she will ask me to hang, but I get the feeling that she wants to me chase her. I’m starting to get pretty annoyed with her lack of communication, and honestly don’t see the point in her still snapping me If she’s not interested in me. Do you think she has any interest at all or is she just playing games for attention? Should I just straight up ask her how she feels or what she wants? I am very confused.",AskMen,AskMen,True

Long story short, I did some things that I shouldn't have coming up two years ago due to addiction and close friends I had haven't spoken to me since. 4 friends - these guys were at my bachelor party, two were in my wedding. I've been in recovery since. I've been in therapy and needless to say it's been hard yet rewarding. The hard part being, dealing with losing my tribe. These guys I knew for over 20 years. Dealing with this has been devastating to me but I'm taking it day by day. I've made some new friends but, there's a void since they left.

Since two years has now passed, I'd like to start out by reaching out by doing so to one of those guys. I'm at a loss of how to approach it. I have their numbers - do I text? Add them on social media and try?

Also not too sure on how to word it. Thought of saying something like:

""Hey X, it's Y. Figured I'd reach out since it's been a minute. Seeing if you're willing to meet up for coffee to talk about some things.""

I'm sure this can be re-worded to be more approachable, looking for some advice here. I want to be cautious and sympathetic because I know they may still be feeling hurt from what I did.

Our sex drives are very different. For me 2-4 times a week is good. For her once or twice a month would be fine and seemingly she doesnt understand or does not take it seriously that i'd really like to have sex more often.
Right now we have sex about once a week or less, but even then I have to start, otherwise she would be fine without it.

She was on holiday with her family in for the past week and before that we didnt meet that much so we didnt have sex for two weeks. Its getting a bit much for me. When I tell her that she laughs it off, she finds it funny that I want to have sex every couple of days.

Even though I told her it is not really funny to me anymore, she seemingly just finds it funny.

How do you handle a situation like that?
Obviously I dont want to force her but just letting her decide when to have sex seems like the same as if I would be the one deciding all the time.

I often run into him at the gym and though we’re both married now (last contact was 2 years ago when he wanted to reconcile and I rejected it numerous times) I can tell it still bothers him to see me. He was finally comfortable enough seeing me there to give me a glare and the “what’s up” head nod. I gestured back but quickly avoided eye contact and bolted the other way. Now if I show up he’s out the door in 2 minutes. That’s how he would act at first. I’d be at the gym and he’d leave within 10 minutes even if he JUST showed up. Eventually he got over the fact that we would run into each other there but since I avoided his gesture recently, he started leaving again when I would show up. 

To give more context, our relationship was 5 months on and off. He ended it multiple times because 1.) I don’t smoke weed and 2.) I believe in God. He equated it to believing in Santa Claus and was convinced I was delusional. As for the weed thing, he wanted a girl that would smoke with him and it just wasn’t my thing anymore. 
He COULD NOT get over that despite how in love we were and how amazing our chemistry was. 2 years ago after a 7 month hiatus he desperately wanted to reconcile claiming he’s completely grown up and changed and wanted to prove it to me but by then it was simply...too late.",AskMen,AskMen,True

Over the years I've read so many comments from men about how they wished people would compliment/notice them. My friends and I, mostly women, are very open and complimentary to each other, and that's always been a source of positivity I'd love for men to experience as well.   
In my younger years, I avoided complimenting straight men because I didn't want to creep guys out by thinking I was hitting on them.   


However, now that I am older and married, I see myself as like a kindly grandma figure, so am now very forthcoming and earnest with my compliments. They are never sexual, but occasionally I'll compliment something physical, especially if the guy seems downtrodden about his appearance. (""You  have a fantastic smile!"" ""Your eyes are a great color."" That kinda thing.)  


A male friend recently told me that I should stop. He said when I give a compliment to a straight guy, friend or stranger, he'll assume I'm hitting on him.
