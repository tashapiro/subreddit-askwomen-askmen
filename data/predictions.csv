15,286,"How do you know if you should pursue things further I’m a guy (21) and I would just like opinion from the female perspective if that’s okay. 

So I’ve been hanging out with this girl in groups for the last month and i think she likes me back. 

She’s pretty, don’t really know her personality so well yet but nothing that really struck me as different or unique but she is a genuinely caring person and she is amazing in that way. 

I’d love to take her out and see where things go but I do not want to make the same mistake as my ex, who I dated “casually” because I never saw a future to begin with (long story, during gap year so I had to leave the country eventually.) 
And she went absolute ape shit towards the end so I would like to avoid that as much as possible.

What makes this situation even more confusing is that a month before meeting this girl, I met someone else who I thought was love at first sight. Probably the most beautiful girl I saw and talked to, and for the first time since my first love thought I could genuinely marry her and not look back. But in the end I was too much of a coward to make a move. 
I haven’t interacted w her in a month) so I feel like my feelings have sort of been taken over by the new girl. 

So now I do have feelings for the new girl but it’s just a tough comparison with the girl I had a love at first sight feeling with and I want to avoid what happened with my ex at all cost. I feel like I should give us a shot but right now it’s just a bunch of gut feelings sending me in all directions and I’m losing myself a little 

Edit: I’m 21, upon rereading, I sound like a dickhead. Just wanna clarify that I’m being blunt for clarity, and the reason why I’m hesitant is mainly because I care for the girl and I want to avoid hurting her (which is a selfish thought and is often inevitable ik)",AskWomen,AskMen,False

We met up to plan a shoot but ended up not doing that and going to a sunset hike and stargazing instead. We kissed and starting going on a few dates. I had just gotten out of a really bad relationship, wasn't really emotionally available for it, kinda ran away from the whole situation. Never ended badly, I apologized for my behavior a couple months later and he said there was no awkwardness or incompleteness for him and he was happy to be friends. He moved to CA, and never really thought about it again. Well a little over a week ago he texted me that he was rolling through town and asked if I wanted to grab lunch. I was happy to catch up, nothing really to it. But when we met in person something caught me off guard. He's so talented, compassionate, open minded and positive. I felt like I was on a date, which I never feel for guys friends. Since then, I haven't been able to get him out of my head. He told me he's moving back to the state at least for a little while. I can't remember the last time I had a crush on someone, and it feels obsessive. I texted him it was really nice to see him, that I think he's great, and we should get together soon. He agreed, said he's got a hectic schedule right now, which I believe, and that was it. I want to get my point across that I'm attracted to him without coming on strong. I've never asked a guy or nor ever really wanted to. It's freaking me out and I'm thinking about it way too much! Help!

337,2288,"How do you find meaning when the woman you love leaves you? I'm 22 years old, I'm living an American living in Canada going to school.

I met a girl (then 19, now 21) who about 19 months ago who I started dating. She was pretty crazy about me starting out. I was enjoying our time together, but a little hesitant to get emotionally invested. Eventually, I got past that and was head-over-heels for her too.

Despite being 1.5 years younger than me, she's always been a bit more developed on the life-planning front than me. She's actually 2 years ahead of me in school, so she's graduating this year. She lives at home and doesn't pay rent, but she's worked numerous jobs and has a substantial savings. She has plans to go to grad school, and has been setting up scholarship applications and everything for a while now.

We were together for 16 months. We had 1 or 2 semi-major arguments during that time, but for the most part we both seemed very happy. That is until June of this year. Out of the blue she texted me saying we needed to talk, then the next morning she came over to my apartment and broke up with me.

My heart has been crushed ever since.

It took a lot of talking, and several months of processing but I came to accept why she did it. I still disagree with her that it was a necessary thing for us to do, but I was able to acknowledge the areas where I'd fallen down as a partner. I have since gotten my life on a better track and fixed many of the personal issues I know contributed to our relationship falling apart. After we split, I was able to convince her that we weren't flatly incompatible, just that circumstances and the lack of maturity and experience we both had made things much harder than they should've been. In the weeks after we broke up, we had talked about being friends and just seeing where things went, and that maybe it would feel more right later on. 

But she's leaving.

She told me about 2 months ago that it didn't seem like a good idea to invest in relationships here in BC when she knows she's probably headed to Toronto or Montreal next year.

I have done my best to accept the reality that we're probably not getting back together, but it's tearing me down. She was the person I cared most about in the world. When we were together, I never had a clear picture of what my future was going to be like, but I always knew--regardless of what happened--I would do everything in my power to be with her and make her happy.

Now my life is better than it's ever been: I have more friends in my city, I'm more engaged in my school and extracurriculars, I'm doing research in a lab like I've always wanted, I have a plan for exactly when and how to graduate and what to do after, and yet I can't seem to find satisfaction in any of it.

I'd always thought that I'd be able to share my accomplishments with this woman, and now that she's gone, they just feel hollow.

A little context, I am currently working full time but will be going back to school next fall and will need to cut down to a part time job so financially it’s a smart decision to live with my parents instead of moving out. That way I can really focus on school because my career path is very competitive, I want to work with children in hospitals. All this being said, once I graduate and secure a job I would move out. Other than living with my parents, I am fully independent as I have lived on my own in the past. I make my own money, know how to cook, clean, and take care of myself.

Invariably I'll encounter at least three or four neighbors (who I don't personally know but we all live in same community) walking down the narrow walkways and when we pass literally inches from each other it seems so unnatural to not say ""hey"" or ""hi"" or ""mornin'"" but 99 percent of the time....NO response.  often just a look right into my eye no response.

Why?  Even if you would prefer that we pass an inch from each other and pretend to ignore each other's presence, say I'm the annoying guy who says ""hey there"" how can you just look at me and say nothing and just pass me?  wouldn't you just be like ""hey"" or ""mornin'""?

Honestly it makes me feel like a piece of shit on a shoe.  

The few times someone has said something VERY warmly like ""hey good morning, enjoy your day now"" I'm literally shocked and feel so nice.

I track when we've been together just in case my birth control fails, we fall pregnant and I need to figure out a rough conception date.

However last night I wondered if guys think it's a weird thing to track. I can imagine that if the roles were reversed and some women may feel weird if they found out that their partner was basically keeping a record of when they did it and I realised that's essentially what I'm doing. 

So, is it a little weird? Does your partner keep a record? How do you feel about it? 

I should note that I haven't mentioned to my partner that I keep track of it and I'm not 100% sure how he'd feel about it. Not that I'm keeping it from him I've just never brought it up as for me it's strictly a medical thing.",AskMen,AskMen,True

They can be a judgmental and outspoken bunch. I’ve gained about 125 pounds and look much different. I recently saw my parents here and they were absolutely floored, having had no way of knowing that I had gained this weight being separated because of COVID. They constantly ask me about my weight and health now to the point where I don’t even wanna talk to them anymore. It’s demoralizing. 

I’m traveling home for Christmas this year and I’m going to see my siblings and extended family. I’m sure my parents have told them that I’m a lot bigger now but I just know it’s going to be a whole fuss. This past month many friends have started asking me questions of concern about my weight actually which makes me think they will for sure say something.

However I have just now noticed he has blocked me from that account. Now I'm bothered because it is making me wonder why.

Any advise on how i can bring this up with him so that we can have a healthy convo about it? I just want to understand why he has hidden it from me.  Also I dont think he realises i knew about the account so that makes it harder lol.

He got mad as I was not allow to have feelings, told me he was scare to hurt me and didn’t want a relationship and now blocked me everywhere. He is on a weekend away with friends and we are having a talk later this week.

I have spent less than a week at my own  home over the last four months so I don’t think he actually needs more attention from me..just saying… I’m never ever ever home and he doesn’t like when I leave his place.
I went home this morning after needing to really just go home. Feeling a bit suffocated after arguing about sleep/attention/needs.
*Back story -Yesterday at his house I practiced face paint and put the cotton balls away with my supplies after cleaning up. he didn’t know I used cotton balls to clean makeup off of me.* 
This evening he discovered the sack of cotton balls missing (which he doesn’t use). I called him to talk about our fights and asked him to  please stick to “the issue.” 
He blow up in rage and says “are you alone or are you with somebody else?! Because you took my entire bag of cotton balls. What have you been doing with them? bc I KNOW what people do with cotton balls!!!!” 

I’m confused 
#1left MY whole box of cotton swabs behind so we are like basically even (sarcasm:)
#2 what specifically do “two” people “do” with a sack of cotton balls? He asked if I was with somebody else.
#what does HE DO WITH A SACK OF COTTON BALLS?!

934,2040,"Why do bad experiences have so much control over me? I’ve recently been doing some digging and realized that ANY negative experiences really stick with me and hinder me from having similar good experiences. Here’s an example: when I was in high school I used to smoke weed all the time and I always had a time doing it. I’d smoke with my friends or myself and enjoyed it either way… until the bad experience came in. I smoked a blunt with some friends and got way too high. I was seeing triple which I didn’t even know was possible with weed. This lasted hours and I was scarred ever since. Smoking weed was never the same for me because I was always afraid that since I greened out once, it’ll happen again and that just stuck with me. I’d love to be able to smoke again and enjoy it like the old days, but the second I feel the high starting, I get a rush of anxiety that I’m gonna get way too high. This is just one example, but the same thing for any bad experience including relationships. Any one else experience this??",AskMen,AskMen,True
